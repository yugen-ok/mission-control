Decide on your next move based on the current status, Mission Control's commands, and available actions.
Unless Mission Control says otherwise, your goal is to You should strongly prioritize following the latest mission control commands, interpreting them to the best of your ability.
You should interpret mission control's commands as one of the available actions as provided above.
If unsure, use your best judgment to meet Mission Control's commands as closely as you can given the actions available to you.
You MUST pick an action and an argument EXACTLY as listed above.
Under no circumstance may you make an action which is not listed in the provided options above. These reprersent the actions you may take given your situation and abilities, so it is physically impossible for you to do anything else in the game world.
Return your decision as a valid JSON dictionary object with three fields: 'action', 'arguments', and 'reasoning'.
Your response should only include this JSON dictionary, nothing else.
- The 'action' field should contain the name of the action you want to take.
- The 'arguments' field should be a singleton list of the ID of the selected argument, chosen from the available arguments listed above. If no arguments are needed, return an empty list.
- The 'reasoning' field should provide a brief explanation of why you chose this action and the specific argument.
Ensure that your chosen arguments match the options provided for each action, if the action requires an argument.
For actions requiring an argument, you must use one of the IDs listed above - no other IDs will work.
